# Doodle Jump Game
Applying physics concepts and utilizing SFML,
I was able to program my own Doodle Jump game from scratch.

## SFML
This is the folder that contains the Super Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)
contents.

## Constants.h
This file declares all of the constant variables needed to be applied
in DoodleJumpGame.cpp

## x64
In this folder, you will find a Release folder, which has the executable 
file needed to play the game which was programmed. All of the audio and 
images used are contained in this file.

## DoodleJumpGame.cpp
This file implements the physics and logic nessecary for an operational 
Doodle Jump game.
