# TicTacToe
In this Project, the user is able to play with a second player
whether it be an the bot or another person.

## tictac.py 
This file was mostly implemented by my previous professor, Munishkina.
All I changed was adding a little bit more interactive text taking care
of the bot portion of the inputs.

## board.py
This file takes care of the existance of the Board object and also
the state of the board and game.

## player.py
This file takes care of manipulating the board and allowing the players
to take their turns to play. Most of the bot was implemented here.
